Repository for BINF 6210 assignment 3. 

The script available is from my assignment 2 part C.

My goal was to create a world map using the ggplot function. With this I ploted the locations of all species in the genus Daphnia all over the world to give a visual of species distribution world wide. The next step was to look at whether more distantly related species tended to be more geographically isolated or not.

It was at this last part I ran into problems both with time and with the code. I was able to make the map that shows species distribution, though spacing out the data tags in regions of high species concentrations I wasn't able to figure out. Because of this I was unable to see with any accuracy the distribution. So I was unable to determine if closely related species reside in locations close to each other.
